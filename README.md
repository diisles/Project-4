# Project-4

## David Isles

### Overview

For my project 4, I will be creating a **Mapping to a Dropped pin app!**
Think a barebones uber/lyft app. In other words a user drops a pin to mark their current location. They then hit a button that will show other users(drivers) within a 5 mile radius to them and track theses users/drivers as their location changes in reference to the dropped pin. 



*In an advanced version, I will add buttons for three kinds of users/drivers to be shown( think different tiers of driver) The user who drops the pin can decide which tier to pick and only users/drivers from that  tier will be shown as they navaigate to the pin dropped. I will also try to show time of arival to the dropped pin*
